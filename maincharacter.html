<h1>Apex Legends how to pick characters</h1>
<h2>Choose the Legend Who Matches Your Playstyle</h2>
<img src="https://twinfinite.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Apex-Legends-.jpg">
<p>In the Apex Arena, all competitors are equals, and the Legends are evenly matched in terms of strength, speed, and firepower. It’s their abilities that set them apart, so you’ll want to pick the Legend that matches your preferred playstyle and complements your squad.</p>

    <p>Want to be the shield between your team and opponents? Jump into the arena as the hearty Gibraltar. How about helping your squad travel long distances to take your enemies by surprise? Pathfinder, with his trusty grappling hook, is your perfect pick. Is supporting your team with health boosts more your style? Lifeline is ready for action. Figure out what role you like to play and try different Legends to see which fits you best.</p>
    <h1>Revive and Respawn Your Teammates</h1>
    <P>A tightly-knit squad can do something critical that no Legend can do alone: bring each other back from the dead. After your health is depleted, you’ll go into a downed state where you’re still alive, but slow and in need of medical attention. If you die before your teammates can help, they have one last shot to save you.

        Every Legend carries a Legend Banner that they drop when they die. Only their teammates can pick these up, and taking one to a Respawn Beacon will bring that Legend back to life. It’s a risky move, because the respawning process takes time and a revived player will return with no weapons or armor. But pulling off a successful resurrection can bring a team back from the brink of defeat, so don’t let the opportunity slip by.</P>
