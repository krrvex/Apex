<h1>Go for the Good Stuff, But Be Careful</h1>
<p>Different sections of the map spawn different tiers of loot – the higher your weapon or armor piece’s tier, the stronger it is, and the better your chance of making it to the end of the match. Some locations on the map are consistently full of high-tier loot, which means everyone will want to get to these spots first. The true motherlode comes packed inside dropships that land at random spots on the map, rewarding anyone who can claim them with the most powerful loot in the game.

    You start each match with no weapons or armor, so you and your squad will have to decide if these high-tier caches are worth the risk each time you play. As for where they are? We’ll let you figure that out on your own.</p>

    <h1>Don’t Let Anything Go to Waste</h1>
    <p>You never know what you’re going to find out there in the arena, so don’t be cautious with the caches you spot. Body armor, weapon attachments, backpack upgrades that allow you to carry more items, and other helpful pieces of gear are all hidden across the arena for you to grab. The inventory system will automatically tell you if a weapon or piece of gear is better than what you already have and keep you from grabbing lower-tier loot. That way, you won’t risk snatching something you can’t use in a panic.

        You and your teammates can help each other by calling out item locations as you spot them. The tagging system also notes an item’s rarity level, so you can snag a higher-level piece of gear that you might’ve missed otherwise. Also make sure to loot fallen enemies - they’ll drop a cache when you take them out, and often have some of the best loot. Always keep an eye out, because you never know when a single piece of armor is going to save you in the end.</p>
